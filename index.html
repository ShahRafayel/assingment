            <p> The pandemic, in many ways, taught some valuable lessons for life –some of them include the value of
                good health of mind and body as well as being compassionate towards others. As we move into the new
                year, it is time to focus on positive changes.</p>

                <h3>Stop blaming yourself</h3>
                <p>At such moments, try to understand important things like the emotions your parents felt when you were
                    born, the happiness of your family when they see you smile, and most importantly, the happy self
                    within. Visit the best memories and try to re-live them to see how happy you were,” says the expert.

                <h3>Take steps to sleep better
                </h3>
                <p>People with depression also struggle from sleeping issues. Following a sleep hygiene can help you
                    rest better.

                    “Dim your lights before going to bed, light a scented, aroma candle in your room, play some soothing
                    music in the background,” suggests the psychologist.</p>

                <h3>This too shall pass</h3>
                <p>Depression is not a lifetime thing. Yes, it is hard for now, but things will get better. It is like
                    the wheel of life. With time the circle will complete, and depression will lift. “Life does not stop
                    when you are depressed. Every new day leads you more close to the end of that sad feeling depression
                    brings to shower you with the happiest sunshine,” says Dhingra. depressionMental Health</p>

            <p>While you may not feel like picking up phone and making an effort to strike a communication, this will
                help you feel much better.

                “Speaking your heart out makes you feel much better as the emotion is conveyed and not confined to only
                you. Hence, the practice of expression can help a long way to recover from depression,” says Dhingra.

            <h1>The link between <br> mental health and Ayurveda.</h1>
            <p>Ayurveda is an ancient holistic system of medicine that is more than just a lifestyle medicine. It
                teaches a person to lead a healthy life by being more in sync with the internal and external
                environment. And your health, even, your personality is highly dependent on the balance of doshas in
                your body.</p>
